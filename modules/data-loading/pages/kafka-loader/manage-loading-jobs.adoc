= Kafka Loader Loading Job Management

Kafka Loader loading jobs are managed the same way as regular loading jobs. The three key commands are

* `SHOW LOADING STATUS`
* `ABORT LOADING JOB`
* `RESUME LOADING JOB`

For example, the syntax for the `SHOW LOADING STATUS` command is as follows:

[source,gsql]
----
SHOW LOADING STATUS job_id|ALL
----

To refer to a specific job instance, using the job_id which is provided when `RUN LOADING JOB` is executed. For each loading job, the above command reports the following information :

* Current loaded offset for each partition
* Average loading speed
* Loaded size
* Duration
