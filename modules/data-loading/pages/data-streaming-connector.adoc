= Data Streaming Connector
:description: A guide to TigerGraph's Streaming Data Connector.
:sectnums:

TigerGraph Data Streaming Connector is a link:https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/overview.html[Kafka connector] that provides fast and scalable data streaming between TigerGraph and other data systems.

== Supported data systems
The data streaming connector supports the following data systems:

* Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* Apache Kafka

== Stream data from Google Cloud Storage
You can create a data connector between TigerGraph's internal Kafka server and your GCS service with a specified topic.
The connector will stream data from the data source in your GCS buckets to TigerGraph's internal Kafka cluster.
You can then create and run a loading job to load data from Kafka into the graph store using the xref:kafka-loader/index.adoc[Kafka loader].

Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

* Your source data files are stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
* You have link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating[generated a key that has access to your source data from your Google Cloud Platform service account].


=== Specify connector configurations
The connector configurations provide the following information:

* Connector class
* Your GCP service account credentials
* Information on how to parse the source data
* Mapping between connector and source file

==== Specify connector class
The connector class indicates what type of connector the configuration file is used to create.
Connector class is specified by the `connector.class` key.
For connecting to GCS, its value is set to `com.tigergraph.kafka.connect.filesystem.FsSourceConnector`.

==== Provide GCP account credentials
You need to provide following information for the connector to access the files in your GCS bucket.
You should be able to find all items on this list in your link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating[service account key]:

* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.auth.service.account.email`: The email address associated with the service account
* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.auth.service.account.private.key.id`: The private key ID associated with the service account used for GCS access.
* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.auth.service.account.private.key`: The private key associated with the service account used for GCS access.
* `file.reader.settings.client_email`:
The service account email.
* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.project.id`: Google Cloud Project ID with access to GCS buckets.
* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable`: Whether to create objects for the parent directories of objects with `/` in their path. For example, creating `gs://bucket/foo/` upon deleting or renaming `gs://bucket/foo/bar`.
* `file.reader.settings.fs.gs.impl`: The FileSystem for gs: (GCS) uris.
The value for this configuration should be `com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem`.
* `file.reader.settings.fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl`: The AbstractFileSystem for `gs:` (GCS) URIs. Only necessary for use with Hadoop 2.
The value for this configuration should be `com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS`.

==== Specify parsing rules
The streaming connector supports the following file types:

* CSV files
* JSON files.
Each JSON object must be on a separate line.
* directories
* tar files
* zip files

For URIs that point to directories and compressed files, the connector looks for all files inside the directory or the compressed file that match the `file.regexp` parameter.
By default, this includes both CSV and JSON files.

If you set `file.recursive` to true, the connector looks for files recursively.


The following parsing options are available:


|===
|Name |Description |Default

|`file.regexp`
|The regular expression to filter which files to read.
The default value matches all files.
|`.*`

|`file.recursive`
|Whether to retrieve files recursively if the URI points to a directory.
|`true`

|`file.reader.type`
|The type of file reader to use.
The only supported value is `text`.
|`text`

|`file.reader.delimited.separator`
|The character that separates columns.
This parameter does not affect JSON files.
|`,`

|`file.reader.delimited.quote`
a|The explicit boundary markers for string tokens, either single or double quotation marks.
This parameter does not affect JSON files.

The parser will not treat separator characters found within a pair of quotation marks as a separator.

Accepted values:

* `single`: single quotes `'` are boundary markers.
* `double`: double quotes `"` are boundary markers.
* Empty string `""`: Quotation marks are treated as ordinary characters.
| Empty string `""`

|`file.reader.delimited.value.default`
|The default value for a column when its value is null.
This parameter does not affect JSON files.
| Empty string `""`

|`file.reader.batch.size`
|The maximum number of lines to include in a single batch.
|`1000`

|`file.reader.text.eol`
|End of line character.
|`\n`

|`file.reader.text.header`
|Whether the first line of the files is a header line.
If the value is set to true, the first line of the file is ignored during data loading.
If you are using JSON files, set this parameter to false.
|`false`

|`file.reader.text.archive.type`
a|File type for archive files.
Setting the value of this configuration to `auto` will allow the connector to decide file types automatically based on the file extensions.
Accepted values:

* `tar`
* `zip`
* `gzip`
* `none`
* `auto`
|`auto`

|`file.reader.text.archive.extensions.tar`
|If a file has this extension, treat it as a tar file
|`tar`

|`file.reader.text.archive.extensions.zip`
|If a file has this extension, treat it as a zip file
|`zip`

|`file.reader.text.archive.extensions.gzip`
|If a file has this extension, treat it as a gzip file
|`gz`, `tgz`
|===


==== Map source file to connector
The below configurations are required:

|===
|Name |Description |Default

| `name`
| Name of the connector.
| None. Must be provided by the user.

| `topic`
| Name of the topic to create in Kafka.
| None. Must be provided by the user.

|`tasks.max`
|The maximum number of tasks which can run in parallel.
|1

|`file.uris`
|The path(s) to the data files on Google Cloud Storage.
The URI may point to a CSV file, a zip file, a gzip file, or a directory

==== Run loading job
Run the loading job created in the last step will load the streamed data into the graph.
If you make changes to the topic-partition configuration file, you can overwrite the values for the filename variables with xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:running-a-loading-job.adoc#_run_loading_job[the `USING` clause].

[,gsql]
----
GSQL > RUN LOADING JOB load_person
----

By default, loading jobs that use Kafka data sources run in streaming mode and do not stop until manually aborted.
As data is streamed from the data source, the running loading job will continuously ingest the streamed data into the graph store.

=== Stream data source updates

To load updates to the data source after you've created the connectors, you need to delete the connector and recreate another connector.

In the future, the streaming data connector will support automatically scanning for updates and stream data to TigerGraph.

== Stream data from an external Kafka cluster
You can create a data connector to stream data from an external Kafka cluster (source cluster) to a destination cluster, which is often TigerGraph's internal Kafka cluster.
If the data from the source cluster is in AVRO format, the connector can transform the data into JSON format.
You can then create and run a loading job to load data from the destination cluster into graphs in your database using the xref:kafka-loader/index.adoc[Kafka loader].

Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

* Your TigerGraph instance has access to your external Kafka cluster

=== Specify connector configurations
Before creating the connector, you must provide the required connector configurations.
This includes <<_basic_configurations, basic configurations>> and <<_subsection_configurations, subsection configurations>>.

The data streaming connector for external Kafka data is based on Apache Kafka MirrorMaker and shares many configurations as MirrorMaker.

[#_basic_configurations]
==== Basic configurations

The configurations in this subsection specify basic characteristics of the connector such as connector class, the addresses of the source and destination clusters, as well as the converters used to covert Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka.

The following configurations are *required*:

|===
|Field |Description |Example value

|`connector.class`
|Must be set to `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorSourceConnector`.
This class of connectors connect a source Kafka cluster to a destination Kafka cluster.
|`connector.class=org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorSourceConnector`

|`source.cluster.alias`
|Alias of source Kafka cluster in string format
|`source.cluster.alias=source-cluster`

|`target.cluster.alias`
|Alias of destination Kafka cluster in string format
|`target.cluster.alias=tg-cluster`

|`source.cluster.bootstrap.servers`
|Address of the external source Kafka cluster
|`source.cluster.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092`

|`target.cluster.bootstrap.servers`
|Address of destination Kafka cluster, which is the Kafka component inside TigerGraph. The ip address can be fetched via gmyip, and default port is 30002.
|`target.cluster.bootstrap.servers=localhost:30002`

|`source->target.enabled`
|Enables source-to-target mirroring.
This field must be set to `true`.
|`source->target.enabled=true`

|`topics`
|Topic names to be loaded into TigerGraph, split by comma `,`
|`topics=test-topic`

|`key.converter`
|Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka.
This controls the format of the keys in messages written to or read from Kafka,
Must be set to `org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`.

|`key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`

|`header.converter`
|Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka.
This controls the format of the headers in messages written to or read from Kafka.
Must be set to `org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`.
|`header.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`

|`value.converter`
a|Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka.
This controls the format of the values in messages written to or read from Kafka.

* If records are in Avro format with Schema Registry service, this field should be `com.tigergraph.kafka.connect.converters.TigerGraphAvroConverter`.

* If records are in Avro format without using Schema Registry service, this field should be `com.tigergraph.kafka.connect.converters.TigerGraphAvroConverterWithoutSchemaRegistry`.

* If records are in plaintext or JSON format, this field should be `org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`.
|`value.converter=com.tigergraph.kafka.connect.converters.TigerGraphAvroConverter`
|===

Other configuration options are available to fine-tune the connector.
You can find all configuration options in https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#georeplication-mirrormaker[Kafka MirrorMaker Configurations].

==== SSL/SASL configurations (optional)
If the source cluster has configured SSL or SASL protocols, you need to provide SSL/SASL configurations to the connector in order to communicate with the source cluster.

You need to upload the following credential files to your TigerGraph cluster:

* If the source cluster uses SASL, you need to upload the keytab of each Kerberos principal to every node of your TigerGraph cluster at the same absolute path.
* If the source cluster uses SSL, you need to upload the trust store and key store to every node of your TigerGraph cluster.
Each file must be at the same absolute path on all nodes.
* If the source cluster uses SASL and SSL, you need to upload the keytab of each Kerberos principal, as well as the key store and truststore to every node of your TigerGraph cluster.
Each file must be at the same absolute path on all nodes.

The following configurations are required for admin, producer and consumer.
To supply the configuration for the corresponding component, replace `<prefix>` with `source.admin`, `producer`, or `consumer`.
For example, to specify `GSSAPI` as the SASL mechanism for producer, put `producer.sasl.mecahnism=GSSAPI`:

|===
|Field |Description

|`<prefix>.security.protocol`
|Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, `SASL_SSL`.


|`<prefix>.sasl.mechanism`
|SASL mechanism used for client connections. This may be any mechanism for which a security provider is available. GSSAPI is the default mechanism


|`<prefix>.sasl.kerberos.service.name`
|The Kerberos principal name that Kafka runs as. This can be defined either in Kafka's JAAS config or in Kafka's config.



|`<prefix>.sasl.jaas.config`
|JAAS login context parameters for SASL connections in the format used by JAAS configuration files.
See link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html[JAAS Login Configuration File] for


|`<prefix>.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm`
|
The endpoint identification algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate. Default is https. Disable server host name verification by setting `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to an empty string


|`<prefix>.ssl.keystore.location`
|The location of the key store file.


|`<prefix>.ssl.keystore.password`
|The password of the key store file.


|`<prefix>.ssl.key.password`
|The password of the private key in the key store file or the PEM key specified in `ssl.keystore.key`.


|`<prefix>.ssl.truststore.location`
|The location of the trust store file.

|`<prefix>.ssl.truststore.password`
|The password for the trust store file.

|===

[#_subsection_configurations]
==== Subsection configurations
The subsection configurations come after the other configurations, and specify the names of the connectors you want to create using the provided configurations before the subsections, as well as the maximum number of tasks that can be created for the connector.

You can create one or more connectors from one configuration file by providing a subsection for each connector you want to create.
In the case of the MirrorMaker connector class used in this procedure, *we suggest you only create one connector from each file*, due to limited available configurations in the subsection.
If you create multiple connectors, they will have almost identical properties.

Start a subsection with a section title enclosed in square brackets.
This title has no effect on the connector to be created, but the titles need to be unique in the configuration file.

The following subsection configurations are available:


|===
|Field |Description

|`name`
|Name of the connector.

|`tasks.max`
|
The maximum number of tasks that to be created for this connector. The connector may create fewer tasks if it cannot achieve this level of parallelism.
The value for this configuration should not be larger than the number of partitions of the topic(s) in source Kafka.
The default value is 1.
|===


==== Example
The following is an example configuration file:

[,text]
----
include::example$config-avro[]
----

The file in the example creates a connector named `avro-test-without-registry` with all configurations specified in the file.

include::partial$create-connector.adoc[]

include::partial$create-data-source.adoc[]

include::partial$create-loading-job-kafka.adoc[]

For example, suppose we have the following graph schema with only one vertex type
 and the following JSON line data in the destination Kafka:

[tabs]
====
Schema::
+
--
[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE VERTEX Company (primary_id name STRING, employee_num INT)
CREATE GRAPH Company_Graph (Company)
----
--
Data::
+
--
[.wrap,json]
----
{"company":"TigerGraph","employee_num":346}
{"company":"Apple","employee_num":373704}
{"company":"Google","employee_num":277618}
----
--
====

To create the loading job, we start by creating a data source configuration file and point it to the Kafka cluster and create the data source:

[tabs]
====
Data source configuration::
+
--
[.wrap,json]
----
    {
        "broker":"localhost:30002",
        "kafka_config":
            {
                "group.id": "tigergraph"
            }
    }
----
--
Create data source::
+
--
Run the following command in GSQL and replace `<path_to_datasource_file` with the absolute path to your data source file to create the data source.
[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE DATA_SOURCE KAFKA k1=<path_to_datasource_file>
----
--
====

Then we create a topic-partition configuration file, and then write the loading job.
In the `LOAD` statement, map the JSON line fields to the corresponding attributes of the vertex types:

[tabs]
====
Topic-partition configuration file::
+
--
[.wrap,json]
----
{
    "topic": "Hello.avro-with-registry-topic",
    "default_start_offset": -2
}
----
--
Loading job::
+
--
[,gsql]
----
CREATE LOADING JOB load_company FOR GRAPH Company_Graph {
    DEFINE FILENAME f1 =
      "$k1:<path_to_topic_partition_configuration>}";
    LOAD f1 TO VERTEX company VALUES ($"company", $"employee_num")
      USING JSON_FILE="true";
}
----
--
====

Once the loading job is created, run the loading job to load data into the graph:

[.wrap,gsql]
----
RUN LOADING JOB -noprint load_company USING EOF="true"
----

There are two modes for the Kafka Loader: streaming mode and EOF mode.
The default mode is streaming mode.
In streaming mode, loading never stops until the job is aborted.
In EOF mode, loading stops after consuming the current Kafka messages.



== Manage connectors

After creating a connector, you can choose to delete it or pause it.
You can also use `gadmin` commands to view status of all existing connectors.

=== List connectors
You can list all running connectors or view detailed configuration of a specific connector.

To view a list of all connectors, run `gadmin connector list` from your bash terminal as the TigerGraph Linux user.

To view configuration details of a specific connector, run `gadmin connector list <name_of_connector>` and replace `<name_of_connector>` with the name of the connector you want to inspect.

=== Pause a connector
Pausing a connector stops the connector from streaming data from the data source.
The data that has been streamed to TigerGraph's internal Kafka can still be loaded into the graph store via a loading job.

To pause a connector, run the below command and replace `<connector_name>` with the name of the connector:

[,console]
----
$ gadmin connector pause <connector_name>
----

=== Resume a connector
Resuming a connector resumes streaming for a paused connector.

To resume a connector, run the below command and replace `<connector_name>` with the name of the connector:

[,console]
----
$ gadmin connector resume <connector_name>
----

=== Delete a connector
Deleting a connector removes a connector.
It stops the connector from streaming, but the data that has been streamed to Kafka can still be ingested by a loading job.
This action cannot be undone and a removed connector cannot be resumed.

To delete a connector,  run the below command and replace `<connector_name>` with the name of the connector:

[,console]
----
$ gadmin connector delete <connector_name>
----

== Known issues

NOTE: Automatic message removal is an Alpha feature and may be subject to change.

Messages in TigerGraph's internal Kafka cluster are automatically removed from the topics at regular intervals.
There are several known issues with this process:

* Messages are only removed if the loading job is actively running.
If the loading job finishes much sooner before the interval is reached, the messages are not removed.
* If loading job uses EOF mode, meaning the loading job will terminate as soon as it finishes, it is likely some partial data will be left in the topic.
* If a topic is deleted and recreated while a loading job on the topic is running, the data in the topic may get removed.
* Deleting the connector does not delete the connect offsets for topics that are mapped to a folder URI.

[CAUTION]
.NULL is not a valid input value.
====
TigerGraph does not store NULL values.
Therefore, your input data should not contain any NULLs.
