Three cloud source types are supported:

* xref:_aws_s3[Amazon S3]
* xref:_azure_blob_storage[Azure Blob Storage]
* xref:_google_cloud_storage[Google Cloud Storage]

Also, three data object formats are supported: CSV, JSON, and Parquet.

=== AWS S3

AWS uses the standard IAM credential provider and uses your access key for authentication.

Access keys can be used for an individual user or for an IAM role.
See Using IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 for more information.

[source,json]
{
"type": "s3",
"access.key": "<access key>",
"secret.key": "<secret key>"
}

=== Azure Blob Storage

We support two types of authentication:

*Shared key authentication*:

Get the account key on the Access Keys tab of your storage account.
TigerGraph can automatically extract the account name from the file URI, so there's no need to provide the account name.

[source,json]
{
"type" : "abs",
"account.key" : "<account key>"
}

**S**ervice principal authentication*:

To use service principal authentication, you must first register your TigerGraph instance as an application and grant it access to your storage account.

[source,json]
{
"type" : "abs",
"client.id" : "<client id>",
"client.secret" : "<client secrect>",
"tenant.id" : "<tenant id>"
}

=== Google Cloud Storage

For GCS, the TigerGraph data source configuration object is based on the _GCS service account key_ format.

[source,json]
{
"type": "gcs",
"project_id": "<project id>",
"private_key_id": "<private key id>",
"private_key": "<private key>",
"client_email": "<email address>"
}

You can follow Google Cloud's instructions for creating a service account key, and then replace the `"type"` value with `"gcs"`.
