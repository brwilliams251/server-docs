=== Continuous Loading from Data Warehouses

If `EOF="true"` (the default), then the query is executed once, and its output will be loaded.

If `EOF="false"`, the query will be executed periodically every `poll.interval.ms` and its output loaded.
This will continuous indefinitely until the job is aborted.
