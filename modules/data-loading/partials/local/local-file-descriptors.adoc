==== Local file descriptors
For local file loading, the `file_desciptor`  is a file path or folder path string, enclosed in quotation marks.  Here are examples of the syntax for various cases:

* An absolute or relative path for either a file or a folder *on the machine where the job is run*:
+
[source,json]
"/data/graph.csv"

* An absolute or relative path for either a file or a folder *on all machines in the cluster*:
+
[source,json]
"ALL:/data/graph.csv"

* An absolute or relative path for either a file or a folder *on any machine in the cluster*:
+
[source,json]
"ANY:/data/graph.csv"

* A list of *machine-specific paths*:
[source,json]
"m1:/data1.csv, m2|m3|m5:/data/data2.csv"
