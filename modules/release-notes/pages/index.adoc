== Detailed List of New Features

=== TigerGraph Server
* xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc[]:
** Added support for the xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc#_define_the_parameters[Parquet file format], widely used for big data.
** Moved data connector setup from `gadmin` to xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/[GSQL commmands], to better align with user personas and privileges.
** Added xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc#_continuous_file_loading [auto-detection of new files] when in Stream mode.
** Significantly improved CPU usage after connector finishes data loading.
** Documented additional xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/aws-s3.adoc#_specify_connector_configurations[S3 authentication configuration parameters].
* Added new xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc[REST Endpoints]:
** `/library` is a set of endpoints for showing and running template queries.
** `/showdelayedlistall` shows how many queries are in the Workflow Manager's delay queue.
* Added a new command for `gadmin backup` to xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:backup-cluster.adoc#_back_up_a_database_cluster[control the number of backups], for better storage space management.
* Expanded the list of xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:reference:error-codes.adoc[system response codes] to include one for an invalid vertex ID.
* Improved the backend security infrastructure for the Kafka loader.

=== GSQL Command and Querying Language

==== Loading

* Moved xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc[data connector] setup from `gadmin` to GSQL.
Streamlined the user experience for creating loading jobs for data stored in AWS, GCP, and Azure, directly integrating the data streaming connector with GSQL and reducing the steps needed to load data.
** Introduced a new `STREAM` data loading type that simplifies the xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:index.adoc[data loading process] from remote data storage.
* Added a new set of loading job xref:3.9@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:functions/token/index.adoc[token functions for string manipulation].

==== Schema
* Full support for xref:3.9@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:defining-a-graph-schema.adoc#_discriminator[
multiple edges of the same type] between vertices, to simplify application design for time series data and other complex large data sets.

==== Querying and Query Management
* `to_string()` is now a built-in GSQL function, supporting all xref:3.9@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:attribute-data-types.adoc#_primitive_types[primitive] and xref:3.9@gsql-ref:querying:accumulators.adoc#_vertex_attached_accumulators
[scalar accumulator] data types. This means xref:3.9@gsql-ref:querying:func/query-user-defined-functions.adoc[user-defined functions] in `Exprfunctions.hpp` may no longer use the name `to_string()` (case-insensitive).
* Added support for batch deletion of multiple edges between vertices, both with GSQL `DELETE` and as a xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_delete_an_edge_by_source_target_edge_type_and_discriminator[REST endpoint].
* Standardized `SHOW PACKAGE` for xref:3.9@graph-ml:using-an-algorithm:index.adoc[packaged queries] to follow the same behavior as other `SHOW` catalog commands.

//=== JDBC Spark Connector
//
//* [Alex] Added support for loading job monitoring on xref:3.9@data-loading:spark-connection-via-jdbc-driver.adoc[JDBC Spark connector] loading jobs.
//* [Alex] Added the ability to assign a specific job ID to a JDBC loading job.
//* [Alex] Added error limiting parameters to JDBC loading jobs to cancel loading automatically when errors surpass a certain threshold.

=== Backup

* [3.8] Added support and a configuration parameter for a
xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:configurations.adoc[user-supplied s3-compatible storage endpoint], typically used when operating in a private network of with a non-AWS S3-compatible service.

=== Kubernetes Operator

* Enhanced the functionality of the xref:3.9@kubernetes:k8s-operator/index.adoc[] so it is now the standard way to perform cluster operations with Kubernetes.
* Added support for xref:3.9@kubernetes:k8s-operator/backup-and-restore.adoc[], xref:3.9@kubernetes:k8s-operator/cluster-operations.adoc#upgrade-cluster-version[upgrading the version of the TigerGraph server], and xref:3.9@kubernetes:k8s-operator/cluster-operations.adoc#update-cluster-resources[updating cluster resources].

=== Security

* Improved the backend security infrastructure for the Kafka loader.
* Added xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:security:index.adoc#_udf_file_scanning[configurable security scanning for UDFs].
* Updated our response to xref:master@home::cve-2022-30331.adoc[CVE-2022-30331].

== TigerGraph Suite Updates
=== Admin Portal

* Reworked the xref:3.9@gui:admin-portal:dashboard.adoc[Admin Portal dashboard] to show the relationship hierarchy and status of all TigerGraph components for at-a-glance understanding of the TigerGraph system.

=== GDS Library and ML Workbench

* Added xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:dataloaders.adoc#nodepieceloader[NodePiece] node embedding algorithm.
* Added pyTigerGraph support for xref:1.3@pytigergraph:core-functions:query.adoc#_runinstalledquery[running queries asynchronously] (i.e., running in the background).

=== TigerGraph Insights

* Added support for multi-user editing and sharing of the same xref:3.9@insights:intro:applications.adoc[applications].
* Added the ability for users to xref:3.9@insights:widgets:index.adoc#_save_a_widget[save a widget] independently instead of tying it to an application.
* Added a mini-map to the xref:3.9@insights:widgets:graph-widget.adoc[graph widgets] for easier navigation.

== Fixed issues

=== Fixed and Improved in 3.9.1
* Fixed sorting issue in a script for upgrading a cluster with more than 9 nodes.
* If a user runs gadmin and the  `~/.tg.cfg` link is missing, display an error message with guidance on how to recreate the link.
* Fixed: GraphStudio not displaying queries for users with the QueryReader role.
* Removed extraneous automatic backup at 12:00am UTC if the user sets `System.Backup.Local.Enable` to `true`.
* Fixed accidental erasure of the `UserCatalog.yaml` file, which caused users to lose access to the database.
* Added support for `DATETIME` datatype in `PRINT â€¦ TO_CSV` statements.
* Added error handling in the case of a name conflict or use of reserved query names among UDF functions.
* Fixed an issue with nested group access in LDAP.
* Fixed an issue with perceived "schema error", which then causes an upgrade to abort.
* Fixed issue with `DISTRIBUTED QUERY` not able to insert on edge.
* Removed C++ headers not on the allowlist from default UDF files.
* Fixed a GSE crash in rare synchronization circumstances in HA clusters.
* Fixed an issue with a query syntax error not being detected at the root cause stage where a clear error message could be issued.
* Added options to configure the frequency of checking for license key violations
* Fixed: GSE does not start or restart after upgrading to 3.9.0 due to change in log synchronization.
* Fixed an issue with lost attribute of a local vertex having `PRIMARY_ID_AS_ATTRIBUTE` =`true`.
* Fixed inability to enable SSL in an HA cluster via the AdminPortal.
* Fixed issue with GPE crashing during heavy workload of a backup retore operation.

=== Fixed in 3.9.0

* Improved stability and security across all components.
* Fixed an issue with the GSQL `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions converting some special characters from UTF-8 to UTF-16.
Previously affected character sets included the Unicode range `0080` to `00A0` and `2000` to `2100` (Near Eastern scripts and some special typographical marks).
* The `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions no longer convert large integers to strings before printing, which had resulted in quotation marks printed along with the number.
* xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:cluster-and-ha-management:expand-a-cluster.adoc[Cluster resizing] no longer requires a graph schema.
* Extended the timeout length for queries in the wait queue so that they are not timed out early.

== Known issues

* Upgrading a cluster with 10 or more nodes to v3.9.0 requires a patch. Please contact TigerGraph Support if you have a cluster this large. Clusters with nine or fewer nodes do not require the patch. (This issue is fixed in 3.9.1)
* Downsizing a cluster to have fewer nodes requires a patch. Please contact TigerGraph Support.
* During peak system load, loading jobs may sometimes display an inaccurate loading status. This issue can be remediated by continuing to run `SHOW LOADING STATUS` periodically to display the up-to-date status.
* When managing many loading jobs, pausing a data loading job may result in longer-than-usual response time.
* Schema change jobs may fail if the server is experiencing a heavy workload. To remedy this, avoid applying schema changes during peak load times.
* User-defined Types (UDT) do not work if exceeding string size limit. Avoid using UDT for variable length strings that cannot be limited by size.
* Unable to handle the tab character `\t` properly in AVRO or Parquet file loading. It will be loaded as `\\t`.
* If `System.Backup.Local.Enable` is set to `true`, this also enables a daily full backup at 12:00am UTC (fixed in 3.9.1)
* The data streaming connector does not handle NULL values; the connector may operate properly if a NULL value is submitted. Users should replace NULL with an alternate value, such as empty string "" for STRING data, 0 for INT data, etc.  (NULL is not a valid value for the TigerGraph graph data store.)
* The `DATETIME` data type is not supported by the `PRINT â€¦ TO CSV` statement (fixed in 3.9.1).
* The LDAP keyword `memberOf` for declaring group hierarchy is case-sensitive.

=== Compatibility Issues
* v3.9+: Some user-defined functions (UDFs) may no longer be accepted due to xref:security:index.adoc#_udf_file_scanning[increased security screening].
** UDFs may no longer be called `to_string()`. This is now a built-in GSQL function.
** UDF names may no longer use the `tg_` prefix. Any user-defined function that began with `tg_` must be renamed or removed in `ExprFunctions.hpp`.


=== Deprecations
* Kubernetes classic  mode (non-operator) is deprecated, as of v3.9.
* The `WRITE_DATA` RBAC privilege is deprecated, as of v3.7.
