This feature is part of our Kubernetes Classic support, which is now deprecated.
New designs should not use this feature.
Future Kubernetes support will use Kubernetes Operators.

Like regular TigerGraph clusters, a TigerGraph cluster deployed on Kubernetes can also be expanded.
When you expand a TigerGraph cluster on Kubernetes, the data across the different nodes are automatically redistributed.

Expanding a cluster requires several minutes of downtime.

== Prerequisites
* A running TigerGraph Deployment in a Kubernetes cluster
* You have configured `kubectl` for access to your running Kubernetes cluster.
* There is some data loaded in your TigerGraph instance.
If the instance is completely empty, cluster expansion fails.

== Procedure

The following are the steps to expand a TigerGraph cluster on Kubernetes

=== Identify new cluster replication and partition
Before running any commands to expand a cluster, make sure you have a clear idea of how the new cluster should be distributed.
You should have the following information:

* The new replication factor of the cluster
* The new partitioning factor of the cluster
* The new size of the cluster

=== Download script

Clone the repository at https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys.

Change into the `k8s` directory.
There is a script named `tg` that you need to perform the actions described in this page.

=== Expand cluster
Invoke the `tg` script with the following arguments to expand the cluster:

[source.wrap,console]
$ ./tg <cloud_platform> expand -s <new_size> -n <namespace> --prefix <prefix>

* Replace `<cloud_platform>` with the cloud platform where your Kubernetes cluster is provisioned. Possible values are: `gke`, `aks`, `eks`.
* Replace `<new_size>` with the new size (the number of nodes) of the cluster.
This value is required.
* Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where your resources reside.
If not provided, the script uses the default namespace `default`.
* Replace `<prefix>` with the Pod name prefix.
If you didn't specify a prefix when creating the cluster, do not specify one here.

For example, to expand a TigerGraph Deployment in the `example` namespace of a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Kubernetes cluster to a 6-node cluster, run the following command:

    $ ./tg gke expand -s 6 -n example
