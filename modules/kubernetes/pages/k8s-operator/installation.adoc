:description: Instructions on how to install TigerGraph Kubernetes Operator.
:sectnums:

This page describes the steps to install TigerGraph Kubernetes Operator on your Kubernetes cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
.Kubernetes Operator is a Preview Feature.
====
Preview Features give users an early look at future production-level features.
Preview Features should not be used for production deployments.
====

NOTE: The Operator only needs to be installed once for each cluster.
If you run into errors saying that Custom Resource Definition (CRD) already exists, it is likely that someone else who has access to your cluster has already installed the operator.
Therefore, you can safely ignore the error and skip installation.

== Prerequisites
* You have configured the `kubectl` command-line tool for access to your running Kubernetes cluster.
* Helm is installed on your local machine.
* https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/[cert-manager is installed on your Kubernetes cluster].
* If you are pulling from a private registry, configure your cluster for access to the registry.
You can do this by https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret[creating a Secret] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#use-case-as-container-environment-variables[using it as a container environment variable].
