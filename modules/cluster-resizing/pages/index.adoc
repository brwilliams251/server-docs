:description: Expand, shrink, or repartition your TigerGraph cluster.
:page-aliases: README.adoc, readme.adoc

As your workload changes, it makes sense to resize your cluster to meet your production needs.
This section describes the steps to perform the following cluster resizing operations:

* xref:expand-a-cluster.adoc[Expand a cluster]
* xref:shrink-a-cluster.adoc[Downsize a cluster]
* xref:repartition-a-cluster.adoc[Repartition a cluster]

[NOTE]
All cluster resize operations require several minutes of downtime.
The exact amount of downtime varies depending on the amount of data and the number of nodes in the cluster.
